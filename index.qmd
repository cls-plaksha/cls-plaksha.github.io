# Computability, Logic, and Systems Group
## Plaksha University

The Computability, Logic, and Systems (CLS) group operates at the intersection of mathematical foundations and modern computational engineering. We explore the theoretical boundaries of computing — from axiomatizability and complexity classes—and apply these principles to build robust, intelligent systems.

Our research bridges the gap between abstract reasoning and physical realization. We study Mathematical Logic and Complexity to understand the limits of computation, utilizing these insights to design post-quantum Cryptographic protocols. Simultaneously, we focus on Artificial Intelligence, investigating both the symbolic reasoning required for planning and the system-level optimizations necessary for training massive multimodal LLMs.
